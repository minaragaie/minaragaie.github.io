## üéØ Project Overview

A sophisticated portfolio platform that showcases professional work through an immersive VS Code-themed interface. The architecture leverages GitHub as the single source of truth for all content, eliminating traditional database dependencies while enabling powerful features like private repository portfolio integration, real-time GitHub activity tracking, and seamless content versioning through Git.

### Key Highlights
- **Zero Database Architecture**: All content managed through GitHub, reducing costs to $0/month for data storage
- **VS Code-Inspired UI**: Complete desktop IDE aesthetic with activity bar, explorer sidebar, draggable tabs, and smooth animations
- **Private Repository Support**: Backend API fetches portfolio content from private repos using authenticated GitHub API
- **Static + Serverless Hybrid**: Frontend served from GitHub Pages (free), backend on Vercel serverless (free tier)
- **Advanced Portfolio Pages**: Rich markdown rendering with TOC search, collapsible sections, reading progress, and Giscus comments

---

## üí° The Problem: Financial Efficiency Without Compromise

Traditional portfolio sites require databases, which add ongoing costs ($5-50+/month), maintenance overhead, and complexity. The challenge was building a production-grade portfolio platform that could:

1. Handle dynamic project listings and content
2. Support private repository portfolios (sensitive client work)
3. Provide admin capabilities for content management
4. Maintain excellent performance and UX
5. **Cost absolutely nothing** in ongoing infrastructure

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architectural Innovation: GitHub as Database

### Why No Traditional Database?

We store **all content in GitHub** and read it at runtime through serverless functions:

**Content Storage:**
- `resume.json` - Single source of truth for projects, experience, education, certifications
- `data/portfolios/*.md` - Individual markdown files for each project's detailed portfolio
- Version controlled with full Git history, PR reviews, and rollback capabilities

**Benefits of This Approach:**
- ‚úÖ **Zero database costs** - No monthly fees, no scaling costs
- ‚úÖ **Version control built-in** - Every change is tracked, auditable, revertible
- ‚úÖ **PR-based workflow** - Content changes go through code review like any other code
- ‚úÖ **Perfect for serverless** - Stateless functions can read from GitHub API on-demand
- ‚úÖ **Backup included** - GitHub is the backup, no separate backup strategy needed
- ‚úÖ **Multi-environment support** - Same code works in dev/staging/prod

**Technology Stack:**
- Next.js 15 (App Router) with `output: 'export'` for static site generation
- React 19 with TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling with VS Code theme system
- Lucide Icons for consistent iconography

**Deployment:**
- Static export built via `npm run build:github`
- Published to `gh-pages` branch using `gh-pages` CLI
- GitHub Pages serves static files with global CDN
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions with environment variable injection

**Key Features:**
- VS Code-inspired UI with activity bar, explorer sidebar, draggable tabs
- Smooth drawer-style sidebar that pushes content with synchronized animations

### Backend: Serverless Functions on Vercel

**Technology Stack:**
- Vercel Serverless Functions (Node.js runtime)
- `@octokit/rest` for GitHub API integration
- GitHub Storage abstraction layer (`github-storage.js`)

**API Endpoint Structure:**
Single unified endpoint pattern: `/api/admin?type={resource}&{params}`

**Available Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/admin?type=resume` - Fetches complete resume data from GitHub
- `GET /api/admin?type=portfolio&slug={slug}` - Fetches portfolio markdown for private repos
- `GET /api/admin?type=github-activity&username={user}` - Unified GitHub repository data, stats, and languages
- `POST /api/admin-auth` - Admin authentication (JWT token-based)
- `GET /api/admin-auth` - Token verification

**GitHub Storage Layer:**
```javascript
// Abstracted GitHub operations
githubStorage.readResumeData()      // Fetches resume.json from repo
githubStorage.getFileContent(path)  // Fetches any file from repo
```

**Private Repository Handling:**
- Uses authenticated GitHub API token (stored in Vercel environment)
- Backend acts as proxy for private repo content
- Frontend never directly accesses private repos (API-only)
- UI displays "Private Repository" badges and lock icons

---

## üé® VS Code-Inspired User Experience

## üîê Admin System: Git-Based Content Management

### No Database, No Problem

Instead of traditional admin UI with database writes, we use **Git as the admin interface**:

**Content Management Workflow:**
1. Admin edits `resume.json` or portfolio markdown files locally or via GitHub web UI
2. Creates a Git commit (or PR for review)
3. Pushes to repository
4. Backend automatically reads updated content on next request
5. No database migrations, no ORM, no schema changes

**Authentication System:**
- JWT token-based authentication
- Credentials stored in Vercel environment variables
- Token expires after 24 hours
- CORS protection and input validation
- Secure error handling (no sensitive data leakage)

**Admin Endpoints** (when running on Vercel, not on static GitHub Pages):
- `POST /api/admin-auth` - Login
- `GET /api/admin-resume` - Read resume data
- `POST /api/admin-resume` - Save resume data
- Delete operations for experience, education, certifications

**Benefits:**
- Content changes are versioned automatically
- PR workflow for content review
- Rollback capabilities through Git history
- Audit trail of all changes
- No database maintenance or migrations

```bash
npm run build:github  # Prepares static export
npm run build         # Next.js static generation
gh-pages -d ./out    # Publishes to gh-pages branch
```

**CI/CD Pipeline:**
- GitHub Actions workflow triggers on push to `main`
- Builds with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` environment variable
- Exports static site to `out/` directory
- Removes Next.js internal `.txt` files
- Publishes to `gh-pages` branch
- GitHub Pages serves files with global CDN

**Environment Variables:**
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` - Backend API URL injected during build
- Supports different URLs for dev/staging/production

## üîÑ Portfolio Migration: GitHub-Based Content

### Evolution from Local Files

Originally, portfolio markdown files were stored locally in the frontend repository. We migrated to a GitHub-based approach:

**Before:**
- Portfolio files stored in frontend repo
- Hard to update (required frontend deployment)
- No separation of concerns
- Difficult to manage multiple projects

**After:**
- Each project repo contains its own `portfolio.md` or `PORTFOLIO.md`
- Backend fetches from GitHub API on-demand
- Projects can update their own portfolios independently
- Public repos accessible directly, private repos via backend API

**Migration Benefits:**
- Decoupled project management
- Each project owns its portfolio content
- Easy to add new projects (just add to `resume.json`)
- Giscus comments per repository (if Discussions enabled)

---

## üìä GitHub Activity Integration

### Unified GitHub Dashboard (`/github/`)

**Features:**
- Repository listing with stats (stars, forks, commits)
- Language distribution visualization
- GitHub contributions calendar chart
- Responsive mobile layout
- Project linking (repos connected to portfolio projects show "View Project" button)

**Technical Implementation:**
- Backend aggregates data from GitHub API
- Caches results for performance
- Supports both public and private repositories
- Real-time stats and language detection

**Mobile Responsiveness:**
- Stacked header on mobile
- Responsive grid (1/2/3 columns based on screen size)
- Full-width buttons for touch targets/deployment
- Smaller icons and text on mobile
- Border separator between card sections on mobile

---

## üéØ Technical Highlights

### GitHub Storage Abstraction

Created a `github-storage.js` module that abstracts all GitHub operations:

```javascript
// Simple, clean API
const resumeData = await githubStorage.readResumeData()
const portfolioContent = await githubStorage.getFileContent('data/portfolios/project.md')
```

This allows the backend to work identically whether:
- Reading from local filesystem (development)
- Reading from GitHub (production)
- Reading from private repos (via authenticated API)

### Dynamic Project Loading

Sidebar and projects section automatically sync with backend data:

```typescript
// Frontend fetches from backend
const { resumeData } = useResumeData()

// Sidebar generates project tree dynamically
const projectsList = resumeData?.projects.map(p => p.slug)
```

No hardcoded project lists ‚Äî everything driven by backend `resume.json`.

### Private Repository Support

Elegant solution for sensitive client work:

1. Project marked with `isPrivateRepo: true` in `resume.json‚îú
2. Frontend requests portfolio via backend API
3. Backend uses authenticated GitHub token to fetch private content
4. Content returned to frontend, displayed normally
5. UI shows private indicators (badges, lock icons)

### Responsive Design Patterns

Comprehensive mobile optimization:

- Breakpoint-based layouts (sm, md, lg)
- Touch-friendly button sizes (44px minimum)
- Stacked layouts on mobile
- Reduced padding and font sizes
- Border separators on mobile for clarity
