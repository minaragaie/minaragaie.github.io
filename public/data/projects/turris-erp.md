## Key Algorithms & Logic

### Overtime Calculation (8-Hour Daily)
```
For each day:
  - Calculate daily_hours = timesheet_hours + travel_hours
  - If weekday: overtime = max(0, daily_hours - 8)
  - If weekend: overtime = daily_hours
  - Distribute overtime proportionally across tasks based on hours worked
```

### Overtime Calculation (40-Hour Weekly)
```
For the week:
  - Calculate total_hours = sum(all_days(timesheet_hours + travel_hours))
  - overtime_hours = max(0, total_hours - 40)
  - Calculate expected_weekday_hours = 40 / 5 = 8
  - For each day, calculate nominal_overtime
  - Distribute overtime proportionally based on actual hours vs nominal hours
  - Allocate to tasks based on time worked per task
```

### Expense Allocation Algorithm
```
For each job worked:
  - Calculate job_proportion = job_hours / total_hours
  - For each expense type (hotel, meals, travel):
    - job_expense = total_expense * job_proportion
  - For tasks within job:
    - Calculate task_proportion = task_hours / job_hours
    - task_expense = job_expense * task_proportion
```

### Special Day Handling
```
For days with expenses but no work hours:
  - Calculate each job's weekly proportion
  - Distribute expenses based on weekly proportions instead of daily
  - Allocate evenly across all tasks within each job
```
